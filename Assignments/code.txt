Here's a simple example code snippet to get you started:

```python
import random


word_bank = ["hangman", "game", "python", "guess"]
secret_word = random.choice(word_bank)
attempts = 6
guessed_letters = []

print("Welcome to Hangman!")
print("The secret word has", len(secret_word), "letters.")

while attempts > 0:
    guessed_word = ""
    for letter in secret_word:
        if letter in guessed_letters:
            guessed_word += letter
        else:
            guessed_word += "_"

    print("Guessed word:", guessed_word)
    print("Attempts remaining:", attempts)

    guess = input("Guess a letter: ")
    guessed_letters.append(guess)

    if guess in secret_word:
        print("Correct guess!")
    else:
        print("Incorrect guess!")
        attempts -= 1

    if "_" not in guessed_word:
        print("Congratulations! You guessed the word correctly:", secret_word)
        return

print("You ran out of attempts. The word was:", secret_word)
